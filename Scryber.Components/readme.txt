-----------------------------------------------------

Scryber is an advanced PDF generation tool that allows
complete definition of a dynamic PDF document based
on XML (and code)  including cascading styles,
databinding and component separation in referenced files.

This framework is built entirely in .NETCore and is
open source under the LGPL licence so you can link to
it in commercial applications.



Thanks for using.

We are still checking and working everything out.
But it's looking good.


Getting Started
---------------

There's an article here about creating your first
document on 'read the docs' here.

MVC Web Application
-------------------

If you are using scryber from a web application
We would recommend using the Scryber.Core.Mvc package
that includes a reference to this package

This can be found here
https://www.nuget.org/packages/Scryber.Core.Mvc/



Mac (or Linux) - Read this.
---------------------------

Scryber needs the GDIPlus capabilies of dotnet.
By default these are not installed.

There is an article here for using homebrew to
install these.
