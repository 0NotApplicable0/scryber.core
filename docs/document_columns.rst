Flowing pages and columns
===================================

Scryber supports flowing content layout. No matter the font, content type or structure.

It is as simple as html.

Specifying columns
==================

All block level components (see :doc:`component_positioning`) support the use of columns.

There is by default on a block a single column, but by specifying a style:column-count (either on the block, or in the style definition) then 
the layout will split the block into that number of regions within it.

Content within the column will flow down as far as it is able (either the bottom or the page, or the maximum height of the container)
and then move to the top of the next column.
