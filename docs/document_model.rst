======================================
Passing data to your document template
======================================

A document template  is just that, a template.
In your development you can add any source of information to be included.

* As a model in an MVC application
* As an object for the parameters
* Bound to a datasource (xml, sql or object)
* As a hook into an event method.

The Document parameters
=======================

Every Document can have parameters associated with it.
These should be declared at the top of the Document, in the Params element for clarity to other developers (even if the default value is empty).
