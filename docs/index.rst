=============
Scryber Core
=============

Create dynamic PDF documents quickly and easily.

Scryber is an open source flexible PDF document generation tool with:

Easy, and intuitive structure
-----------------------------

Whether you are using xml templates or directly in code, scryber
is quick and easy to build complex documents from your designs and data.


Intelligent flowing layout engine
---------------------------------

In scryber, content can either be laid out explicitly, or jut flowing with the the page.
Change the page size, or insert content and everything will adjust around it.

Cascading Styles 
----------------

With a styles based structure, it's easy to apply designs to templates. Use class names, id's or component types,
or a combination of all 3 to apply style information to your documents.

Low code, zero code development
-------------------------------

Scryber is based around xml templates - just like XHTML. It can be transformed, it can be added to,
and it can be dynamic built. By design we minimise errors, reduce effort and allow reuse.

Binding to your data
--------------------

With a simple binding notation it's easy to add references to your data structures and pass information
and complex data to your document, or get the document to look up and bind the data for you.
