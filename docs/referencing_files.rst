=============
Splitting your document(s) into multiple files
=============

For large documents or projects, it's often easier to split your templates into multiple files.
These can be separate stylesheets, pages, components and the top level document.

As a converions the files should have the following extensions.

* Documents - [MyDocument].pdfx
* Stylesheets - [MyStyles].psfx
* Pages - [MyPage].ppfx
* Components - [MyComponent].pcfx

It just makes life easier.
